There once was a fat witch. She was so fat she could barely move. In was the 
end of the 1600's. It was 1693 to be exact, in Salem Massachussetts. Everybody
was beinf tested to see if they were a witch or not. Poppe, the fat witch,
too. No one expected her to float because of ginormous size. But... she
floated. Silence wahsed over the hallow court room with peaked ceiling. Not
a create was stirring, not even a mouse. Poppe was sentenced to death.
